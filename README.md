## General

SEEREP aims at improving the understanding of unstructured environments for
robotic systems. For that, SEEREP provides a **SE**mantic **E**nvironment
**REP**resentation for planning and reasoning algorithms. The main features of
SEEREP include:

- Fast spatio-temporal-semantic queries with
  [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/).
- Storeage of data generated by the robotic system.
  - Offline on the robot, e.g. no or slow internet connection.
  - Save data on a server-cluster with
     [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/)
- Switch between [Protocol Buffers
  (PB)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) /
  [Flatbuffers (FB)](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) as the messaging
  format.

## Why

Most present environment representations focus on one or two domains, e.g.
spatial-temporal. But in order to enable a robot to fully understand its
environment on a higher level, a spatio-temporal-semantic representation is
needed. Semantic entries are especially useful to disambiguate sensor data based
on the context.

## Overview of SEEREP

The following graphic provides a high level overview of SEEREP and its
above-mentioned features.
